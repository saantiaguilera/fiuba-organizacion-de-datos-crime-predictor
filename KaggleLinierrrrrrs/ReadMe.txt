	- Remove unused variables (

- Counters for crimes in matrix - DataManager.h
- Good cases, total cases, limiter i - CrimePredictor.cpp
- Limiter i - CrimeParser.cpp
- Numbers for parsing and predicting - stdafx.h
- Time - KaggleLinierrrrrrrrrrs.cpp

	- Currently its not predicting from another file. constants for modifying how much predicts / parses is in stdafx.h
	- Should start using new file + 
		* instead of printing should put stats in a .txt file
		* the .txt file should be accordingly to the kaggle format asked in the evaluation zone (idOfCrime, CATEGORY1, CATEGORY2, ..., CATEGORYn, probabilityCategory1, ..., probabilityCategoryN)



PROBABILITY ACHIEVED WITH THIS CONSTANTS = 98.35%
TIME ACHIEVED WITH THIS CONSTANTS ~ 50s
